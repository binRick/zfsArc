Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC) is a page replacement algorithm with better performance[1] than LRU (least recently used). This is accomplished by keeping track of both frequently used and recently used pages plus a recent eviction history for both. The algorithm was developed[2] at the IBM Almaden Research Center. In 2006, IBM was granted a patent for the adaptive replacement cache policy[permanent dead link].
